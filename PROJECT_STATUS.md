# high-signal — PROJECT STATUS

Last updated: 2026-07-13

## Why/What

**Thesis:** One product — a synthesized **Daily Brief** from many noisy public sources across technology, startups, and finance. Global by default; region is a free filter. Five brief sections: (1) stocks watching, (2) business ideas, (3) lifestyle trends, (4) brand perception (connected brand), (5) product improvements (connected brand). Free; no billing.

**In scope:** Daily Brief (`/` `/brief`), Signals feed, Evidence, Track Record, source ingest pipeline, Markets lens, Communities input, Mentions, Agent Eval, Domains (drank companion), Convergence, Unmapped gazetteer, Equities snapshot, operator review/admin, plans 0008–0012 scaffolds.

**Out / parked:** Lab as product infrastructure, personal/operator cockpit as headline product, standalone equities terminal, standalone communities product, broad source expansion without quality gates, paid tiers, per-platform Mentions fan-out, knowledgebase service dependency.

## Dependencies

### External

- **Auth:** Clerk (app shell, admin proxy). Worker admin routes use `ADMIN_TOKEN` bearer.
- **Deploy:** Cloudflare Workers — `high-signal-web`, `high-signal-api`, D1 `high-signal-db`; annotation worker separate deploy.
- **Email:** Cloudflare `send_email` binding (`SEND_EMAIL`) for brief delivery (plan 0009).
- **AI:** OpenAI-compatible endpoint via `AI_BASE_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL`, `HIGH_SIGNAL_AI_API_KEY`.
- **Ingest sources:** SEC EDGAR, HKEX, yfinance, Polymarket/Manifold/Kalshi/Metaculus, GDELT, RSS, Guardian, FRED, Semantic Scholar, Bluesky, Podcast Index, NVD, CISA KEV, VC/fund portfolio directories, and 50+ other adapters (see ingest pipeline). 55 catalog sources, 43 with live data in D1 (180K+ events).
- **Optional source keys:** Guardian, SAM, Companies House, Metaculus, Bluesky, Podcast Index, FRED, Semantic Scholar, Etherscan, Token Unlocks, Artificial Analysis, OpenRouter, Libraries.io, Replicate.
- **Active source keys (set in GitHub Secrets):** `EIA_API_KEY`, `OPENSTATES_API_KEY`, `FDA_API_KEY`, `CONGRESS_API_KEY`, `FEC_API_KEY`, `BEA_API_KEY`, `CENSUS_API_KEY`, `LDA_API_KEY`, `USDA_NASS_API_KEY`, `REGULATIONS_GOV_API_KEY` — all via a single api.data.gov key (registered autonomously via AgentMail + Playwright).
- **Legacy cron fallback:** `MODAL_TRIGGER_*` for Modal long backfills only.
- **Env (representative):** `SEC_USER_AGENT`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `API_BASE` (brief delivery).

### Internal fleet

- **drank:** Web authority companion — `/domains` lens; data via public GitHub JSON + `pnpm drank:sync`.
- **starboard / researchPapers:** Cross-repo ingest adapters referenced from README pipeline list.
- **SaaS Maker:** Personal command brief scripts sync tasks via `pnpm personal:brief sync-tasks --apply`.

- Next.js web app and Cloudflare Worker API monorepo are in place.
- Clerk auth is wired for the app shell with admin helpers.
- Primary nav now reflects active scope: brief, track record, lenses (markets, watchlist, mentions, agent eval, domains), ops (review, settings, explore). Removed dead `/discover` nav link (communities product is parked; link caused prod smoke 404).
- Public/support pages exist: about, methodology, featured, API docs, privacy, terms, auth pages.
- `/explore` ships a canonical sitemap of every reachable surface (brief, signals + evidence, entities, lenses, ideas/opportunities/teardowns, equities, operator/admin, docs), with `new | operator | admin | parked` flags. The site footer now groups links into Product / Lenses / Operator / Legal so nothing built becomes invisible from the homepage.
- Plan 0008/0009/0010/0011 surfaces are reachable from primary nav and the footer: `/watchlist/entities` (nav lenses), `/settings/delivery` (nav ops + footer), `/mentions/[brandId]` (linked from each row in `/mentions`), `/agent-eval/[auditId]/attributes` (linked from each audit panel in `/agent-eval`), `/admin/delivery` (linked from `/explore` under operator/admin). Plan 0012 adds an `intent` tab under `/mentions/[brandId]`.
- Removed `@saas-maker/ops`, `@saas-maker/ai`, `@saas-maker/analytics-sdk`, and shared eslint/tsconfig npm deps (2026-06-20). Workers use local `ai-client.ts`; root lint uses Biome.

```

**Data ownership:** D1 is canonical for signals, evidence, entities, mentions, agent-eval, markets, delivery, watchlists, cited URLs. Git markdown under `signals/` is human-readable source synced into D1. JSON bundles (`equities-snapshot`, `price-context`, `market-refreshes`, `known-tickers`) are derived artifacts from `data/equities-snapshot.jsonl` — not independent market-data sources. Prediction markets (`market_quotes`) are separate from equity prices.

## Timeline

- **2026-07-13** — Completed the remaining local-code follow-ups for plans 0008 and 0010. Auto-publish now prefers structured claim links with an explicit legacy fallback; `/review` lazily and idempotently backfills historical claims; stock items expose compact “why this is here” provenance; and signed-in briefs compose up to five suppression-aware direct/one-hop watch impacts, omitting any item without evidence-backed claim linkage. No migration, production config, or deploy was run.
- **2026-07-13** — Added the versioned public `GET /learning/daily` feed for the Fleet unified-learning pipeline. It reuses the canonical Daily Brief composer in-process, emits only compact stock/idea/trend learning items with citations, and deliberately excludes owner-specific perception and improvement sections. Focused API typecheck and full worker test suite pass.
- **2026-07-05** — Added **India D2C Opportunity Pipeline** (plan 0013, Slices 1 + 2). 20 hand-curated India D2C niches → deterministic 0–100 opportunity score → `test / watch / avoid` verdict → `OpportunityBriefPayload` rendered in `/opportunities` (new "India D2C Opportunity Briefs" section) and Daily Brief section 02 (3 briefs for `south-asia`, 1 rotating for `global`). Reuses the existing Opportunity Brief contract — no new component, no D1 migration (JSON artifacts first per the PRD). New `packages/shared/src/content/d2c-opportunities.ts` (seed + `scoreD2CNiche` + `verdictForScore` + `composeD2COpportunityBrief` + `d2cBriefItems`); weekly Python collector `python/ingest/.../d2c_opportunities.py` pulls Reddit/HN/Product-Hunt samples for the 20 niches and writes cited JSON artifacts under `data/d2c-opportunities/`; `scripts/d2c-opportunities-bundle.ts` bundles the latest artifact into the shared package so the worker renders cited evidence without a runtime fs read. Fragile sources (Google Trends, Meta Ad Library, marketplace pages) degrade to `null` with a `freshnessDate`. No impuls8 data read or redistributed; no paid source dependency. Tests: `d2c-opportunities` (TS, 32) + `test_d2c_opportunities.py` (10). Run: `pnpm d2c:collect` then `pnpm d2c:bundle`. Slices 3 (scoring history + D1 persistence) and 4 (agent-visibility overlay) deferred.
- **2026-07-13** — Completed plan 0011's remaining local-code follow-ups: `/mentions` now uses topic/prompt product language, completed mention checks rebuild cited-source evidence independently from intent-opportunity refresh, and visibility reports support owner access or a deterministic brand-scoped HMAC share token. Token creation is owner-gated and token reads fail closed without the existing server signing secret. Migration `0012_cited_url_index.sql` remains an operator apply step; no migration, secret, config, or production change was performed.
- **2026-07-08** — Added **India D2C Opportunity Pipeline Slices 3 + 4** (plan 0013). **Slice 3 — D1 persistence + history:** migration `0016_d2c_opportunities.sql` adds `d2c_niches`, `d2c_niche_snapshots`, and `d2c_agent_visibility` tables (additive, no changes to existing rows). Drizzle schema added in `packages/db/src/schema.ts`. New pure functions in `@high-signal/shared`: `computeD2CDelta` / `computeD2CDeltas` (score delta + verdict-change trend: new/improved/degraded/stable), `assessAging` (aged-well / aged-poorly / stable / insufficient-history), `verdictImproved`, `buildSnapshotRecord`. `scripts/sync-d2c-opportunities.ts` loads the latest JSON artifact into D1 (idempotent upsert by niche + snapshot_date). New `GET /d2c/opportunities` and `GET /d2c/opportunities/:slug` routes read from D1 with seed-fallback. `/opportunities` page now fetches the live API and renders score deltas (±N wk), verdict shifts, and aging. `.github/workflows/cron-d2c-opportunities.yml` runs the weekly Monday 07:00 UTC pipeline: collect → bundle → sync → commit. **Slice 4 — agent-visibility overlay:** `python/ingest/.../d2c_agent_visibility.py` asks each configured AI assistant "What are the best <category> brands in India for <target user>?" for all 20 niches, extracts recommended brands + cited URLs, computes a 0–1 gap score (0 = saturated, 1 = wide-open), and writes `data/d2c-agent-visibility/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`. `scripts/sync-d2c-agent-visibility.ts` persists the overlay into D1. `GET /d2c/agent-visibility` returns the latest run. The Opportunity Brief now overrides the weekly snapshot's `agentVisibilityScore` with the more-recent overlay gap when available, and `/opportunities` renders "AI recommends: <brands>" or "no brand named — wide-open" per niche. New pnpm scripts: `d2c:agent-visibility`, `d2c:sync`, `d2c:sync:remote`, `d2c:sync-av`, `d2c:sync-av:remote`. Tests: +22 TS (d2c-opportunities now 54) + 10 Python (`test_d2c_agent_visibility.py`). Full `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm test` + `pnpm lint` + `uv run pytest` + `uv run ruff` green.
- **2026-07-05** — Added **Opportunity Briefs** to Daily Brief section 02. Business ideas now carry a decision-grade payload with `enter/test/watch/avoid` verdict, confidence, target user, problem, market-timing reasons, evidence mix, competitor/pricing/agent-visibility notes, risks, next validation step, and prior hit-rate context when available. Seed fallback ideas demonstrate the full workflow in empty-D1/anonymous views; live community-digest ideas receive conservative validation-oriented defaults until deeper source extraction is added. No migrations, new dependencies, or provider keys.
- **2026-07-09** — Added `/case-studies` as a generated High Signal company-universe surface with individual pages at `/case-studies/[slug]` and paginated index pages at `/case-studies/page/[page]` (50 companies/page). `pnpm company-universe:build` writes `apps/web/src/data/company-universe.json` from source-backed fund/company directories (a16z official investment list, Bessemer official companies, Sequoia official spotlights, plus VCBacked fund-directory pages for a16z/Sequoia/Bessemer). Current artifact: **2,181 companies**, all with deterministic competitor mappings from inferred category, shared investor/source evidence, source-directory cohort, and description keyword overlap. Added D1 persistence in migration `0017_company_universe.sql` plus `pnpm company-universe:sync` / `pnpm company-universe:sync:remote`; API reads are exposed at `/company-universe` and `/company-universe/:slug`. The static JSON remains a build/cache artifact, not the long-term source of record. Added `vc-portfolios` to the source catalog.
- **2026-07-09** — Added **company lookup/create** for `/case-studies`. Migration `0018_company_lookup_create.sql` adds on-demand metadata (`status`, `domain`, `requested_by`, `requested_at`, `last_enriched_at`) to `company_universe_companies`. `POST /company-universe/lookup` now normalizes a submitted company name/domain, returns an existing D1 company when matched, or creates a `pending_enrichment` company with operator-submitted provenance and deterministic first-pass competitor edges from the D1 company universe. `/case-studies` includes a lookup form, and `/case-studies/[slug]` falls back to live D1 data for lookup-created companies while still serving generated artifact companies. Production migration/sync not run in this session.
- **2026-07-04** — **AI Visibility (GEO) upgrade** to close the gap vs pure-play GEO tools (Value AI Labs, Peekaboo). Turned the Mentions lens from a single-endpoint, regex-graded check into a real GEO product: (1) **multi-model fan-out** — `resolvePlatforms` runs each prompt across every configured provider (ChatGPT/Gemini/Perplexity/Claude via OpenAI-compatible endpoints), tagging real platforms instead of one `custom` bucket; single-endpoint fallback preserved; (2) **LLM-judge analysis** — `mention-judge` grades each answer (negation-aware sentiment, prose ranking, real recommendation, citations) with the deterministic analyzer as fallback; (3) **persona segmentation** — migration `0015_mention_personas.sql` adds `persona` + `brand_recommended` + `judge_reasoning`; visibility sliceable by buyer persona; (4) **packaged AI Visibility Report** — `composeVisibilityReport` returns a 0–100 score + grade, per-model × per-persona breakdown, share-of-voice vs competitors, citation gaps ("sources AI trusts that aren't you"), and prioritized recommendations, on `GET /products/mentions/:brandId/report`. Also fixed a latent bug: competitor share-of-voice keyed on `[object Object]` because `toMentionRows` cast competitor objects to strings. New suite `ai-visibility` (30 tests); 16 → 17 suites. **Operator step to light up multi-model:** set `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` on `high-signal-api`; without them it runs single-endpoint as before. Agent-Eval multi-model fan-out deferred (Mentions powers the report).
- **2026-07-04** — Completed plan 0009 brief email delivery (wired the sweep into the `*/30` `scheduled()` cron, live-brief compose, HMAC one-click unsubscribe, 3-strike auto-disable; fixed 3 typecheck errors that left the feature non-compiling). Added `rankEvidenceUrls` to fix a credibility-critical defect: brief citations were leading with off-entity/low-authority sources (Bajaj article under HCL, crates.io under Alphabet, Manifold markets under Intel). Then fixed the root cause upstream in the Python generator: title-weighted attribution with a min-strength floor + a conservative evidence-relevance filter, so off-entity events are no longer attributed or cited (Planned #14, DONE). Then two ranking/guard follow-ups: prediction markets are demoted below all non-market evidence in `rankEvidenceUrls` (crowd opinion never leads), and `buildStocks` drops prediction-market-only signals at read time (canonical `isPredictionMarketOnly` lifted into `@high-signal/shared`, shared with `auto-publish-rules.ts`). **Merged (PRs #34/#35/#36) and deployed to production** (`high-signal-api` + `high-signal-web` Workers); verified live: the market-only Intel signal is gone, Alphabet/HCL lead with on-topic sources, 0 market-only signals in the brief. Test suites 15 → 16 (TS) + `test_entity_attribution.py` (11, Python); `evidence-ranking` 19.
- **2026-07-02** — Added `app.onError()` global error handler to API worker (`workers/api/src/index.ts`).
- **2026-06-09:** Production deploy verified (web + api Workers).
- **Migrations 0000–0007:** Applied; canonical D1 schema for signals, evidence, entities, markets, etc.
- **Migrations 0008–0013:** Applied to remote D1 (2026-06-28). 0008 was manually applied earlier (column + index existed); marked as applied and 0009–0013 applied via `wrangler d1 migrations apply --remote`.
- **Plan 0007:** Lab substrate — partial (local docker Postgres, HN ingest, scorer, FastAPI feed); parked as product infrastructure.
- **Plans 0008–0011:** Claim provenance, brief delivery, watchlists, and OpenLens visibility are wired. Plans 0008, 0010, and 0011 local-code follow-ups are complete; remaining external/operator work is tracked separately.
- **2026-06-30:** Added and scaffolded plan 0012 after reviewing Octolens, Peekaboo, and Subreddit Signals. Decision: beat them by combining AI visibility, citation/source gaps, community buyer intent, proof tasks, and Daily Brief/report outputs instead of copying separate social-listening, GEO, or Reddit-lead dashboards.
- **2026-07-02:** Revamped `/` and `/brief` first viewport around the product loop: market change, buyer intent, AI visibility, and proof gaps. The UI now uses a sharper Aceternity-inspired dark grid treatment while keeping the app surface evidence-first and dense.
- **2026-07-03:** Collapsed the active product shell around data, signals, history, and evals. `/` now renders the signals feed, with Global / US / China / India scopes, default company/idea focus lists, and a fixed sidebar. `/data` is a compact clickable source directory: only sources with stored events open, and they open the latest available source-day view. Signal detail pages link cited evidence back to source-day data when the evidence source maps to the catalog.
- **README status date (2026-05-30)** lags this file for day-to-day scope; `PROJECT_STATUS.md` + `package.json` scripts are authoritative.

## Features (shipped)

### Product shell & navigation

- Primary nav + `/explore` sitemap: brief, signals, evidence, lenses (markets, watchlist, mentions, agent eval, domains), operator surfaces, legal.
- Footer grouped Product / Lenses / Operator / Legal.
- Default `/` is the signals home feed. Primary navigation is grouped into `data`, `signals`, `history`, and `evals`; `/brief` remains the source-linked daily brief.
- Public pages: `/about`, `/methodology`, `/featured`, `/api-docs`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`.
- Clerk auth; region picker and seed product pickers on brief.
- SEO JSON-LD tests (`pnpm seo:test`).

### Daily Brief

- `/` and `/brief` render five sections with hit-rate inline on stock claims.
- Worker `GET /brief/daily?region=&owner=` composes from D1 with seed fallback.
- Worker `GET /learning/daily` publishes a compact versioned learning feed derived from public brief sections only.
- Section 02 ideas now render Opportunity Brief context: verdict, confidence, target user/problem, evidence mix, why-now, risk, next validation step, and prior hit-rate where present.
- Digest surfaces: `/digest` (RSS/Atom), `/daily`, `/daily/history`, `/daily/sources`, `/daily/tasks`.
- Convergence callout above composer pulls multi-source entity hits + prediction-market drift.

### Signals, evidence, track record

- D1 tables: `signals`, `evidence`, `score_runs`, `entities`, `relationships`, `events`, `source_documents`.
- Git-versioned markdown store; `pnpm signals:sync:*` scripts.
- Public routes: `/signals`, `/signals/[slug]`, `/signals/today`, `/signals/types`, `/signals/types/[type]`, `/embed/[slug]`.
- `/signals` supports Global / US / China / India scopes plus company/idea focus lists. Signed-out users get a default watchlist for immediate testing; signed-in users can replace it with configured mention brands.
- `/signals/[slug]` shows confidence score, confidence band, source-class reasons, quotes/excerpts, and source-day links back into `/data/:source?date=YYYY-MM-DD` when the evidence maps to the catalog.
- Worker: `GET /signals`, `/signals/facets`, `/signals/:slug`, `/signals/by-entity/:entityId`.
- Review queue `/review`; auto-publish rules (`scripts/auto-publish-drafts.ts`, 29+ rule tests).
- Track record: `/track-record`, `/track-record/labels`, `/backtest-workbench`.
- Worker: `GET /track-record`, `/cohorts`, `/series`, `/workbench`, `/labels`.
- Label backtest replayed weekly by `cron-backtest.yml`.

### Plan 0008 — Signal provenance editor

- Migration `0009_claim_provenance.sql` — **Applied to remote D1** (2026-06-28).
- Tables (local schema): `claim_records`, `claim_evidence_links`, `claim_timeline_events`.
- Shared helpers: `packages/shared/src/claim-provenance.ts`.
- Read routes: `GET /claims/:id`, `GET /claims/by-signal/:slug`.
- Admin write routes: POST/DELETE claim evidence, status, corrections.
- Web: inline provenance editor on `/review`; public provenance section on `/signals/[slug]`.
- Auto-publish consumes structured evidence when claims exist; `/review` lazily backfills historical signals through an authenticated idempotent route; stock brief cards expose compact provenance.
- Tests: `scripts/claim-provenance.test.ts` (36 unit tests) plus structured auto-publish coverage.

### Plan 0009 — Brief distribution (scaffolded)

- Migration `0010_brief_delivery.sql` — **Applied to remote D1** (2026-06-28).
- Tables: `delivery_preferences`, `delivery_log`, `delivery_snapshots`.
- Worker `/delivery/*`: preferences, log, test, cron `POST /delivery/internal/run`.
- Email: Cloudflare `send_email` binding; MIME in `workers/api/src/lib/email.ts`.
- Next.js proxy: `/api/delivery/[...path]`.
- Web: `/settings/delivery`, `/admin/delivery`; admin summary `GET /admin/delivery/summary`.
- Tests: `scripts/brief-delivery.test.ts` (24 unit tests).

### Plan 0010 — Entity watchlists & impact chains

- Migration `0011_watchlists.sql` — **Applied to remote D1** (2026-06-28).
- Tables: `watchlists`, `watchlist_entities`, `watchlist_suppressions`, `watchlist_delta_log`.
- Worker `/watchlists/*`: list/create, add/remove entities, suppressions CRUD, `GET /:id/impact`.
- Next.js proxy: `/api/watchlists/[...path]`.
- Web: `/watchlist/entities`, `/watchlist` hub; "Watch" on `/entities/[id]`.
- Shared impact composer: `packages/shared/src/watchlist-impact.ts`.
- Signed-in `/brief/daily?owner=...` responses include a fault-isolated `watching` block; every surfaced item is linked to an evidence-backed claim and renders relationship/provenance context in `/brief`.
- Tests: `scripts/watchlist-impact.test.ts` (22 unit tests).

### Plan 0011 — OpenLens visibility (scaffolded)

- Migration `0012_cited_url_index.sql` — **Applied to remote D1** (2026-06-28).
- Table: `cited_url_index`.
- Worker under `/products/mentions/:brandId/*`: visibility-matrix, share-of-voice, cited-sources, trends, report.
- Worker: `GET /products/agent-eval/:auditId/attributes`.
- Shared: `packages/shared/src/openlens-visibility.ts`.
- Web: `/mentions/[brandId]` (visibility, sources, trends, report tabs); `/agent-eval/[auditId]/attributes`.
- Tests: `scripts/openlens-visibility.test.ts` (32 focused assertions).

### Plan 0012 — AI visibility and Reddit intent response (scaffolded)

- Competitor references: Octolens (broad social listening, API/webhooks/MCP, Slack/email), Peekaboo (AI visibility score, AI-engine tracking, citations/content pickup, GSC/Looker/GA/CMS integrations), Subreddit Signals (Reddit buyer-intent classification, subreddit discovery, reply guidance, managed service).
- Product decision: do not create three standalone products and do not reopen a broad "steal list." Most primitives already exist in Mentions, Agent Eval, plan 0011, `opportunities.py`, and brief sections 4/5.
- Migration `0014_intent_opportunities.sql` — **Pending on remote D1** (additive: new `intent_opportunities` table + indexes, no data changes). Safe to apply.
- Worker routes under `/products/mentions/:brandId/intent-opportunities`: list, refresh from recent D1 community events, best-effort Agent Eval evidence-task linking, status update, and optional AI reply-draft generation. Mention checks also trigger a defensive background intent refresh.
- Web: `/mentions/[brandId]?tab=intent` renders the brand intent inbox with refresh, draft, done, and dismiss actions; linked evidence tasks are indicated inline; report tab includes top open intent items.
- Remaining: apply migration 0014.
- Plan file: `plans/0012-ai-visibility-and-reddit-intent-response.md`.

### Source ingest pipeline

Python adapters under `python/ingest/src/high_signal_ingest/sources/` — all wired on daily or wider-window cron unless noted:

- **Capital/filings:** SEC EDGAR (8-K, 10-Q/K, Form D/S-1/4/13F), HKEX, IR pages, SEC XBRL fundamentals, Companies House (optional key), USPTO PatentsView (API transition — may return empty).
- **Equities:** Universe 3,226 tickers; yfinance EOD via `equities_daily.py`; `/equities` page; `cron-equities.yml` 21:30 UTC weekdays; tier-1 derivations + tier-2 macro (ECB FX, optional FRED).
- **Jobs:** Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby public boards (curated slugs).
- **Builder:** GitHub releases/trending/archive, Hugging Face Hub, npm/PyPI + OSV, starboard stars.
- **Research:** Semantic Scholar (the papers source). A dedicated arXiv adapter was built and then removed — papers are already covered by Semantic Scholar, no second firehose wanted. OpenAlex remains **not implemented** (was previously over-claimed here).
- **Litigation:** **CourtListener** (`courtlistener.py`, keyless Free Law Project API) — antitrust / IP / M&A opinions; queries scoped to tech/finance and deliberately low-volume/high-precision (case captions like "Brandt v. nVidia" map to entities; the downstream entity gate drops the rest). Corroboration role, classified `official`.
- **Discourse:** **Hacker News** (`hackernews.py`, keyless Algolia API — direct pipeline source, ~10 domain queries × 2 pages, points floor; was previously Lab-only), **Stack Overflow** (`stackexchange.py`, keyless — 15 AI-infra tags, tech-adoption signal; thin post-LLM but functional), Reddit (13 subs), YouTube discovery + transcripts, Bluesky (optional auth), Lobste.rs, Substack RSS, Techmeme, Podcast Index.
- **YouTube brand-awareness probe (2026-07-09):** `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` is stored in Infisical (`dev`) and unlocks official YouTube Data API search/view-count ranking for `scripts/youtube-brand-awareness-probe.py` / `pnpm youtube:brand-probe`. Probe learning: official API is useful for discovery and `>10k views` filtering; it does **not** provide arbitrary third-party transcripts. No-key transcript extraction via `youtube-transcript-api`/`yt-dlp` worked briefly on sample brands (Perplexity, Cursor, Lovable) but then hit IP blocks / HTTP 429, so production transcript coverage needs a provider/proxy-backed lane. Treat YouTube as brand-awareness/perception weak evidence, not cite-or-kill primary evidence.
- **Energy:** **EIA** (`eia.py`) — monthly industrial electricity price for 14 states; numeric-series-as-events. **LIVE** (2026-06-26): key obtained autonomously (Playwright drives the signup form + AgentMail receives verification + key emails), stored in Infisical (Fleet/`dev`) + GitHub repo secret + wired into `cron-ingest`. 56 events.
- **Startups / demand:** **Product Hunt** (`producthunt.py`, keyless RSS — new launches; avoids the OAuth API), **Google Trends** (`google_trends.py`, keyless daily-trends RSS — demand-side signal for new-ideas; noisy, curated downstream), **Apple App Store** (`appstore.py`, keyless top-free chart RSS — consumer *traction*, distinct from PH *launches*). 35 / 20 / 50 events.
- **Reviews / perception (§4 + idea-mining):** **App Store reviews** (`appstore_reviews.py`, keyless iTunes RSS — resolves brand→app-id via the free Search API) and **Google Play reviews** (`playstore_reviews.py`, free `google-play-scraper` lib, lazy-imported optional dep, seeded package names). Real user reviews (1★ complaints = pain-points/idea fuel) for a curated app set + `APPSTORE_REVIEW_APPS`/`PLAYSTORE_REVIEW_APPS` override (point at a connected brand for §4). 95 / 180 events. **SaaS web review sites (Trustpilot/G2) have no free API** — Cloudflare-walled; the only free path is *headed* Playwright (works, but needs xvfb on CI + is anti-bot-fragile), deferred until §4 perception is a priority.
- **Policy:** Federal Register, Regulations.gov (optional), SAM/SBIR/USAspending; **OpenStates** (`openstates.py`) — state-legislature bills (federal→state→municipal policy stack). **LIVE** (2026-06-26): key provided by operator, stored in Infisical + GitHub repo secret + cron-wired. 71 events (Virginia data-center bills: site assessment, sound profile, water use). Classified `official`.
- **Municipal land-use (GatherGov-style):** `legistar.py` — free, key-less Legistar/Granicus Web API across ~18 city/county councils, biased to data-center/fab corridors verified reachable on the API (Phoenix, Mesa, Goodyear, **Maricopa County**, San Jose, Santa Clara, San Antonio, Columbus, Atlanta, **Mecklenburg/Charlotte**, **Racine County** = Microsoft Mount Pleasant; `LEGISTAR_CLIENTS`-overridable). Keyword-filters recent `Matters` to data-center / rezoning / power-purchase / development-agreement items (procedural minutes/communications dropped); classified `official` (counts toward cite-or-kill). **Role = corroboration, not standalone signal** (decided 2026-06-26): municipal records are overwhelmingly entity-less (parcels, local LLCs, thematic items) — verified true entity-map rate ≈1/48 in a 30-day window — so they publish only when they name a tracked data-center operator (5C, QTS, Compass, Vantage — added to the seed; common in NoVA campus filings) or corroborate an existing signal as an official 2nd source. A thematic `data_center_buildout` signal type exists in `signal_types.yaml` and is offered to the LLM for entity-mapped clusters; **standalone entity-less municipal signals are deferred** (would require generator changes to the publish path — see Planned #10). **Tier C (meeting-video transcription, GatherGov's actual moat) is out of scope** — company-sized ASR effort; reopen only if a watchlisted data-center jurisdiction publishes *only* video and its signal is proven valuable. The highest-value region (NoVA Data Center Alley — Loudoun/Prince William/Fairfax/Henrico) and marquee fab towns (Intel Ohio/Oregon, Samsung Taylor, Micron Syracuse) are **not** on Legistar; reaching them needs per-jurisdiction agenda/PDF scraping (CivicPlus/self-hosted), also deferred under the corroboration-only decision.
- **Markets:** Polymarket, Manifold, Kalshi, Metaculus (optional token) — probabilities only, not equity prices; **CoinGecko** (`coingecko.py`, keyless) — crypto trending coins + 24h movers (fills the zero crypto-coverage gap), **DeFiLlama** (`defillama.py`, keyless) — on-chain protocol TVL + 1d moves (capital flows, non-redundant with CoinGecko prices). 15 / ~5 events.
- **Macro:** ECB FX + FRED (`macro_rates.py`); **BLS** (`bls.py`, keyless v1 API, optional `BLS_API_KEY` for v2 limits) — latest CPI / core CPI / unemployment / nonfarm payrolls / earnings / PPI prints as dated events (release-timing gap that FRED's series don't give). 6 events. **SEC Form D** (private fundraising / "who just raised") is already ingested by `edgar` — surfacing it as a startups funding feed is a brief-composition task, not a new source.
- **News:** GDELT, 50+ RSS feeds, Guardian (optional key).
- **US government RSS:** `us_gov_rss.py` — SEC litigation, FTC, DOJ, CFTC, GAO, Nasdaq halts (keyless RSS, 42 events). Historical temporal — enforcement actions and halts have lasting relevance.
- **US government APIs:** `us_gov_api.py` — CFTC COT, Treasury, BEA, Census, Congress, FEC, LDA, CFPB, FDA, NIH, NSF, USGS, NOAA, USDA (1,524 events). Series temporal — macro indicators, legislative tracking, grants. Keyed via api.data.gov.
- **India government:** `india_gov.py` — SEBI, RBI, MOSPI, BSE, NSE, AMFI, NPCI, data.gov.in (11 events). Series temporal. Keyless except data.gov.in.
- **Global macro:** `global_macro.py` — IMF, World Bank, BIS, UN Comtrade (39 events). Series temporal. Keyless.
- **Crypto on-chain:** `crypto_onchain.py` — mempool.space, L2Beat, CoinMetrics, Etherscan, Token Unlocks (4 events). Series temporal. 3 of 5 sub-sources keyless.
- **AI benchmarks:** `ai_benchmarks.py` — LMSYS Arena (keyless), Artificial Analysis, OpenRouter (1 event). Series temporal. LMSYS works keyless; other two need keys.
- **Developer ecosystems:** `dev_ecosystems.py` — Papers with Code, GitLab, Docker Hub, dev.to, libraries.io, Replicate (90 events). 4 of 6 sub-sources keyless.
- **Attention:** Wikipedia pageviews API `GET /attention/:article`; Wikidata enrichment `/enrich/ticker`.
- **Security:** NVD CVE, CISA KEV.
- **Temporal relevance classification (2026-06-28):** Each source tagged `recent` (29 sources — news, social, RSS, stale after days), `historical` (14 — patents, filings, court cases, full archive has value), or `series` (9 — macro, rates, benchmarks, on-chain, both recent prints and historical trends matter). Surfaced in the data directory UI with icons (● ▤ ∿) and contextual notes on source detail pages.

**Operator tooling:** `pnpm source:diagnose`, `pnpm source:quality -- --json`, `docs/ingest-runbook.md`, `docs/source-coverage.md`. Source document dedupe by `document_key` (migration `0008_source_document_keys.sql` — **applied to remote D1** 2026-06-28: column + unique index + backfill). `/admin/events` preserves rich payloads with error logging.

**Data catalog, directory & grouping (2026-06-26 — "get all data and group them, no RAG"):**
- **Storage model** — *extract info and keep the link*: events persist `source_url` + a short extracted `title`/`content` summary (cap 20 KB, usually <2 KB) + dedup hash; raw HTML/PDF/JSON that's one query away is **not** stored. Footprint ≈ KB/day of new signals, low-MB total in D1.
- **`docs/source-catalog.md`** — the data-source table (provider, access/auth, history depth, official-class, role, temporal relevance, extracted fields). Single source of truth `source_catalog.py` (CATALOG), regenerated via `python -m high_signal_ingest.source_catalog`; a test asserts it matches the pipeline `Source` list (no drift). 52 sources.
- **`data_directory.py`** — `python -m high_signal_ingest.data_directory` runs the parallel `fetch('all')`, buckets by source, and writes `data-directory/` (git-ignored, regenerable): `INDEX.md` + one JSON of recent samples per source. Verified live: **180,537 events across 43 source families** in D1 (2026-06-28).
- **`grouping.py`** — deterministic, no-vector grouping of *all* events (incl. entity-less, which the generator drops) by entity + theme (keyword buckets) + source family + day, with a **convergence view** ranking groups by distinct-source corroboration (the cite-or-kill precursor).
- **`dedupe.py`** — deterministic cross-source de-duplication (no embeddings): union-find over **shared canonical URL** (scheme/www/query/fragment stripped; HN's embedded article link extracted) + **title token-Jaccard** (≥0.6, guarded by same-day or shared entity). Collapses the same story from HN/Reddit/Techmeme/news into one, **keeping the distinct-source count as corroboration** (dedup ≠ discard the signal). Wired into `opportunities.py` (no duplicate opportunities) and `data_directory.py` (INDEX reports raw→unique + corroborated count).
- **`opportunities.py`** — RedShip-style (redship.io) monitored, scored inbox over the community sources (Reddit/HN/Stack Overflow/Lobsters/Substack): each item scored 0-100 by brand-keyword relevance + buying/pain intent (reuses `analysis.lightweight_nlp`) + recency, ranked. Deterministic; LLM reply-drafts/alerts/SEO-ranking deferred (map to the existing **Mentions**/**Communities** lenses — see below).

### Lenses & intelligence helpers

- **Markets:** `/markets`, `/markets/history`; prediction-market quotes with auto-publish guardrails; worker `/markets/*`.
- **Communities:** Tracked-subreddit CRUD, digest generation (LLM or deterministic); feeds brief sections 2–3; `/communities`, `/communities/[subreddit]/[period]`; worker `/products/communities/*`.
- **Mentions:** `/mentions`; brand configs, prompts, checks, monitors, competitor report; real LLM fail-closed without `HIGH_SIGNAL_AI_API_KEY`; badge widget.
- **Agent Eval:** `/agent-eval`, `/agent-eval/sample`, `/agent-eval/seo`; 8-area evidence scorer + reel briefs; deterministic fallback without AI key.
- **Domains:** `/domains` — DR leaderboard + nominations from drank companion via `pnpm drank:sync`.
- **Convergence:** `/convergence`; `GET /convergence?hours=&min_sources=` — multi-source entity aggregation + market overlay.
- **Unmapped:** `/unmapped`; `GET /unmapped?hours=` — ticker/bare-entity candidates with one-click CSV row via `/enrich/ticker`.
- **Entities & graph:** `/entities`, `/entities/[id]`, `/entities/[id]/[period]`, `/sectors`, `/opportunities`, `/ideas`, `/personal` (operator, parked as headline).
- **Equities:** `/equities` sortable table from snapshot pipeline.
- **Lab:** `/lab` UI exists; substrate local-only (plan 0007 partial — docker Postgres, HN ingest, scorer, FastAPI feed).

### Operator, automation & CI

- Admin worker routes: sync, scores, events, quotes, ingest-runs, llm-runs, audit summary, pending-scores, backfill-entities.
- GitHub Actions: `ci.yml`, `cron-ingest.yml`, `cron-score.yml`, `cron-markets.yml`, `cron-equities.yml`, `cron-backtest.yml`, `cron-publish.yml`, `personal-brief.yml`, `weekly.yml`, `backfill.yml`.
- Personal command brief scripts → SaaS Maker task sync (`pnpm personal:brief sync-tasks --apply`).
- Annotation worker deploy + contract tests (`pnpm annotation:test`).

## Todo / Planned / Deferred / Blocked

### Planned

0. **Cloudflare CPU abuse incident mitigated (2026-07-12):** Workers analytics
   attributed more than 90% of billing-period CPU to `high-signal-web` and
   `high-signal-api`. A live trace identified a single unverified hosting-ASN
   scanner issuing random page/date combinations over plain HTTP at roughly
   166k requests/day since July 3. The web Worker now rejects the evidenced
   source before OpenNext and redirects all other HTTP requests to HTTPS before
   application execution. A second live trace showed verified GPTBot walking
   unbounded historical `/data/*` and `/daily*` combinations; verified AI
   crawlers now retain reader-facing content but receive a cheap 404 on those
   query-heavy history surfaces, which are also excluded in `robots.txt`. Keep
   the exact-IP guard until traffic remains normal for a full billing cycle;
   prefer a Cloudflare WAF rule when zone-level rules permission is available.

1. **Remaining source API keys (manual signup needed):** `FRED_API_KEY` (macro rates — highest value, 2 min signup), `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` (Ethereum gas, 2 min), `COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY` (UK filings, 3 min). All others have keyless alternatives or are niche — see session notes. AgentMail inbox `highsignal-keys@agentmail.to` is set up for registrations.
3. **Plan 0009 follow-ups:** Email Routing operator setup (DKIM/SPF + `EMAIL_FROM`) is the only remaining blocker. Delivery is otherwise complete: the `*/30` cron now runs the sweep in `scheduled()` (fail-closed + idempotent), live-brief compose feeds the email, one-click unsubscribe (HMAC token, RFC 8058 `List-Unsubscribe`) works from any mail client, and 3 consecutive failures auto-disable a channel.
6. Clarify event semantics — `normalized_events` vs current `events` as source observations.
7. Keep source pipeline small and quality-gated; run `pnpm source:quality` after full ingest.
8. Promote `/unmapped` candidates into seed CSV; expand curated adapter lists before new firehoses.
9. Tighten brief quality — evidence links, hit-rate context, cull weak inputs.
14. **Evidence attribution — DONE (2026-07-04, credibility-critical).** The live `/brief/daily` (2026-07-04) showed evidence URLs mis-attributed to the wrong entity: HCL `design_win` cited a Bajaj Housing Finance article; Alphabet `capex` cited `crates.io/hashbrown`; Intel `partnership` led with Manifold prediction markets. Root cause: attribution (`_event_entity` → `primary_entity`) scanned the full scraped body (`content[:4000]`) and returned the alphabetically-first gazetteer hit, so a single incidental mention in a "top movers" widget / related-article rail / crate description won. Fixed across three layers:
    - **Attribution** (`extract/entities.py`): `primary_entity` is now title-weighted (`entity_scores`: title match ×4 + body ×1) with a min-strength floor (`_MIN_PRIMARY_SCORE=2`) — an entity mentioned once outside the title is too incidental to own the event → returns None. `_event_entity` scores title + an 800-char lead only (not `[:4000]`). Adapter-assigned `primary_entity_id` (filings/IR) stays authoritative.
    - **Evidence relevance** (`generator.py` `_relevant_events`, applied in `generate` + `generate_batch`): drops an event from a candidate's evidence when its title+lead names *other* tracked entities but neither the subject nor a spillover candidate. Conservative — events naming no tracked entity (bare filings) are kept.
    - **Display** (`brief.ts` `rankEvidenceUrls`, shipped earlier): the two citations a reader sees lead with the strongest/on-topic source.
    - **Market handling** (deployed follow-ups): `rankEvidenceUrls` demotes prediction markets below all non-market evidence (crowd opinion never *leads* a claim), and `buildStocks` drops prediction-market-only signals at read time — a live check found a published Intel signal evidenced entirely by Manifold that the draft-time KILL rule had missed. Canonical `isPredictionMarketOnly` + `PREDICTION_MARKET_DOMAINS` now live in `@high-signal/shared`, shared with `auto-publish-rules.ts` (single source of truth).
    Tests: `tests/test_entity_attribution.py` (11) + `scripts/evidence-ranking.test.ts` (19). **Declined:** a full entity-relevance floor in `auto-publish-rules.ts` — it would duplicate the gazetteer in TS; generation-layer filtering is the correct home for topical relevance.
13. **FINRA short interest (deferred — feasible, fiddly):** free + non-scraping positioning signal (days-to-cover, squeeze risk; maps to tickers). API confirmed accessible at `api.finra.org/data/group/otcMarket/name/consolidatedShortInterest?format=json` (returns real rows at small limits), but the data-platform API caps `limit` low, rate-limits aggressively, and needs offset-pagination + a latest-settlement-period filter to surface notable shorts. Needs a focused pass with proper pagination + backoff; not worth blocking the clean sources. Reopen when wanted.
10. **Entity-less thematic municipal signals — DONE (2026-06-26).** `run()` no longer discards entity-less events: after the entity loop, `_emit_thematic_drafts` clusters them by theme (`grouping.classify_themes`), and themes in `_THEME_SIGNALS` (currently `data-center-buildout` → `THEME_DATACENTER`/`data_center_buildout`) emit a thematic signal **only when backed by ≥2 distinct sources AND ≥2 distinct URLs** (cite-or-kill). Keyed to a seeded `THEME_DATACENTER` pseudo-entity (type=sector, FK-valid, excluded from the gazetteer so it's never *detected* from text). Uses `generator.thematic_candidate` (a real evidence body, not the auto-killed "fallback" marker), so it can publish on its own merit. Additive — never affects the entity path. Add more themes by extending `_THEME_SIGNALS` + seeding a `THEME_*` row. This also unblocks the Tier-B scrapers (NoVA/fab-town records, also entity-less) whenever they're built.
11. **Common-word ticker/alias collisions in the entity gazetteer — DONE (2026-06-26).** `entity_gazetteer` auto-added every ticker as a case-insensitive word-match, so common-English-word tickers polluted the map across **all** text sources (`net`→Cloudflare on "net income", `meta`→Meta on "meta-learning", plus `onto`/`form`/`snow`/`arm`). Fixed in `extract/entities.py` with **case-aware matching**: these six match only the uppercase/`$`-prefixed ticker form (the unambiguous company ref), not the lowercase word; each still resolves via its distinctive full name (Cloudflare, Snowflake, FormFactor, Onto Innovation, Arm Holdings, Meta Platforms/Facebook). Bare-alias cases `TOGETHER`/`SANCTUARY` fixed earlier by tightening aliases.
12. **RedShip-style engagement layer (partial — scorer shipped, rest deferred):** redship.io = Reddit monitoring → 0-100 relevance scoring → daily opportunity inbox → reply drafts → SEO-ranking → alerts. Mapping to High Signal: monitoring + scoring + inbox is **shipped** as `opportunities.py` (deterministic, over all community sources, generalised beyond Reddit). Already-existing analogues: the **Mentions** lens (brand/competitor monitoring, checks), **Communities** lens (tracked subs, digests), and the brand-connected Brief sections 4/5. **Net-new pieces:** (a) auto-keyword generation from a submitted website — deferred; (b) **LLM reply-draft suggestions — DONE** (`opportunities.draft_reply`, via the OpenAI-compatible gateway; operator *suggestions*, not auto-posts; `None` without a key; CLI `--reply --brand --brand-blurb`); (c) SEO-opportunity detection (posts ranking on Google) — deferred (needs SERP data); (d) real-time Slack/email/webhook alerts — deferred (worker/Mentions surface). **Reopening trigger for the deferred pieces:** a brand is connected and wants actionable engagement on the web surface.
13. **Plan 0012 follow-ups:** apply migration 0014. The main intent inbox scaffold, best-effort evidence-task linking, defensive post-check refresh, report section, and operator-reviewed AI reply drafts are in place; this remains a packaging/workflow gap around already-shipped primitives, not a new broad competitor-steal roadmap.
15. **Plan 0013 — India D2C Opportunity Pipeline (Slices 1–4 DONE 2026-07-08):** 20 curated India D2C niches → deterministic 0–100 score → `test/watch/avoid` verdict → `OpportunityBriefPayload` rendered in `/opportunities` and Daily Brief section 02 (south-asia: 3, global: 1 rotating). Weekly Python collector writes cited JSON artifacts; `pnpm d2c:bundle` bundles the latest into the shared package. **Slice 3 (DONE 2026-07-08):** D1 persistence via `d2c_niches` / `d2c_niche_snapshots` tables (migration 0016), score deltas + verdict-change trends + aging rendered in `/opportunities`, weekly GitHub Actions cron (Mondays 07:00 UTC). **Slice 4 (DONE 2026-07-08):** agent-visibility overlay — `d2c_agent_visibility` table, Python runner asks each AI assistant "best <category> brands in India for <target user>?", extracts recommended brands + cited URLs, computes a 0–1 gap score; the brief overrides `agentVisibilityScore` with the more-recent overlay gap and `/opportunities` renders "AI recommends: <brands>" or "no brand named — wide-open". No impuls8 data, no paid sources. **Operator step to light up the overlay:** set `AI_API_KEY` on the GitHub Actions secrets (or run `pnpm d2c:agent-visibility` locally with `AI_API_KEY` exported); without it the overlay records gap=1 "wide-open" entries.

### Deferred

- **Lab** — local discovery substrate only; not product infrastructure.
- **Personal/operator cockpit** — `/personal` internal tooling.
- **Standalone equities UI** — data feeds brief, not a stock terminal.
- **Standalone communities product** — digest input to ideas/trends only.
- **Broad source expansion** — only when corroboration, novelty, entity coverage, or hit-rate improves.
- **Paid plans / billing** — until usage proves willingness to pay.
- **Per-platform Mentions/Agent Eval fan-out** — single OpenAI-compatible endpoint today.
- **Knowledgebase integration** — separate fleet service; no dependency yet.
- **Signal Studio / marketing playgrounds** — discussed in README; not scoped.

### Blocked

- Brief delivery requires `EMAIL_FROM`, `API_BASE`, Email Routing, destination verification before cron sends real mail.
- USPTO PatentsView in ODP transition may return no events.
- Worker `scheduled` handler no-ops unless `MODAL_TRIGGER_URL` set; daily ingest/scoring primary path is GitHub Actions.
- `send_email` binding declared in `workers/api/wrangler.toml`; operator checklist in file comments.
- Production: Cloudflare Workers; no secrets in repo. Modal retained for manual long backfills only.
