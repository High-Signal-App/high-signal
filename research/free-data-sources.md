# Free data sources — deep research

> **Scope:** every free (keyless or free-registration-key) data source that adds **net-new value** to the High Signal Daily Brief, verified June 2026.
> **Target regions: India + US.** Other-region sources are included only when globally relevant (IMF, World Bank) or when they cover entities/sectors that matter to India+US readers. EU/Japan/Korea/Brazil-only sources are demoted to Tier 2.
> **Method:** 7 parallel research subagents did live web searches across finance, crypto, startups, tech/dev/AI, news/media, government/policy/legal (US+intl), and India-specific sources. Findings were cross-checked against the existing 45 sources in `source_catalog.py` and deduplicated.
> **Existing 45 sources** (do NOT re-add): `edgar, sec-xbrl, hkex, ir, companies-house, github, github-archive, huggingface, packages, patents, semantic-scholar, reddit, hackernews, stackexchange, producthunt, google-trends, appstore, appstore-reviews, playstore-reviews, lobsters, bluesky, youtube, substack, techmeme, podcast-index, news, guardian, gdelt, gov, gov-contracts, regulations, legistar, openstates, courtlistener, markets, metaculus, coingecko, defillama, bls, macro-rates, eia, wikidata, nvd, cisa-kev, jobs`. Plus yfinance EOD for the equities snapshot (not a catalog source; covers Indian tickers via `.NS`/`.BO`).

## How to read this doc

- **Tier 1** = ship next. High net-new value for India+US, official where possible, easy to wire.
- **Tier 2** = ship after Tier 1 is stable. Strong value but more friction, or non-target-region.
- **Tier 3** = nice-to-have. Adds breadth but lower marginal signal.
- **Deferred — paid only** = confirmed no viable free tier. Listed so we don't re-research.
- **Official (⚖️)** = counts toward the cite-or-kill ≥2-source bar. Government / regulator / exchange / central bank / on-chain RPC.

## Top recommendations — ranked by marginal value to the India+US brief

## Implementation notes

- **India official sources** (`sebi`, `rbi`, `mospi`, `bse-announcements`, `nse-announcements`, `amfi`, `upi-npci`, `rbi-payments`, `data-gov-in`) are the **highest-priority gap fill** — the stack currently has zero India-specific official sources despite India being a target region.
- **`mospi`** is especially notable: official MCP server at `https://mcp.mospi.gov.in/` with no auth required — India's BLS+BEA equivalent.
- **`nse-announcements`** uses unofficial JSON endpoints with anti-bot headers — needs careful implementation (browser-like headers, rate limiting).
- **`upi-npci`** and **`rbi-payments`** are web tables, not APIs — need scraping with maintenance.
- **`india-screener`** (Screener.in) has no official API but is the most comprehensive free source for Indian stock fundamentals. Multiple MCP servers and Python scrapers exist. Use with rate limiting + robots.txt respect.
- **SDMX sources** (IMF, BIS, UN Comtrade) share a common format — consider a single SDMX adapter.
- **RSS feeds** (news, newsletters, gov press releases, SEBI, RBI, BSE) can be added to the existing `news.py` RSS bundle — no per-feed adapter needed.
- **`l2beat`** and **`lmsys`** use undocumented APIs — wrap defensively.
- **`opensea`** keys expire after 30 days — needs refresh mechanism (Tier 2).
- **FINRA short interest** (deferred in PROJECT_STATUS.md #13) is confirmed feasible with public credential (10 GB/month) — worth re-attempting with proper pagination + backoff.

## Suggested next steps

1. **Ship India official sources first** (`sebi`, `rbi`, `mospi`, `bse-announcements`, `nse-announcements`, `amfi`) — biggest gap, all keyless, immediate value for India target region.
2. **Ship India news + startup RSS** (`india-moneycontrol`, `india-business-standard`, `india-cnbc-tv18`, `india-hindu`, `india-yourstory`, `india-inc42`, `india-entrackr`, `india-analytics-mag`) — cheap RSS, fills India discourse gap.
3. **Ship US official keyless sources** (`cftc-cot`, `treasury-yields`, `sec-litigation`, `ftc`, `doj-antitrust`, `cfpb-complaints`, `nasdaq-halts`, `gao`, `nih-reporter`, `nsf-awards`, `usgs-earthquakes`, `noaa-weather`).
4. **Ship global macro** (`imf`, `worldbank`, `bis`, `un-comtrade`).
5. **Obtain free keys** for `bea`, `census`, `congress`, `fec`, `lda`, `fda`, `usda-nass`, `data-gov-in` — store in Infisical + GitHub repo secret (same pattern as `EIA_API_KEY`).
6. **Ship crypto on-chain** (`etherscan`, `mempool-space`, `token-unlocks`, `l2beat`, `coinmetrics`).
7. **Ship AI benchmarks** (`artificial-analysis`, `openrouter-data`, `lmsys`).
8. **Bulk-add US + India RSS feeds** to the news bundle.
9. **Ship tech/dev sources** (`papers-with-code`, `libraries.io`, language package registries, `gitlab`, `docker-hub`).
10. **Update `source_catalog.py`** as each source ships; regenerate `docs/source-catalog.md`.
11. **Re-attempt FINRA short interest** (PROJECT_STATUS.md #13).
